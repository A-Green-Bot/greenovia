   git clone https://github.com/A-Breen-Bot/greenovia.git
   cd greenovia
   ```

2. **Create & Activate a Virtual Environment:**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Ensure `requirements.txt` includes Flask, Flask-Login, SQLAlchemy, python-dotenv, etc.)*

4. **Configure Environment Variables:**  
   Create a `.env` file with the following (update values as needed):
   ```
   SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI=your_database_uri
   SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
   ```

5. **Initialize the Database:**
   ```bash
   flask db upgrade
   ```
   *(If using Flask-Migrate, otherwise set up your database manually)*

6. **Run the Application:**
