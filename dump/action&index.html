      <p>Pollution : The presence in or introduction into the environment of a substance or thing that has harmful or poisonous effects.</p>
      <p> Recycle : Convert (waste) into reusable material. </p>
      <p> Green Bots was founded by four beautiful minds: Ashley Brown, Pranathi Bhat, Darsh Chavre and Daniel Dohou. These young minds and future tech giants came together to innovate and solve the problem of Global Pollution.
        The difficulties caused by the contamination of Earth’s resources are saddening, an example is the landfills, and their threat to aquatic life, among many others.
        The contamination of the Earth is a global problem that can never be totally stopped, because as humans, we tend to create more waste as we live. Pollution cannot be stopped, but it can be greatly reduced through Recycling. 
        At Green Bots, we try our very best to create awareness on environmental pollution. We have trained an AI model, GreenBot. GreenBot helps our users identify human waste, and classify these wastes as biodegradable, food waste, non biodegradables, and recyclables. Then, our users are educated on how they can recycle waste.
        We are confident in our product, and it helps us raise awareness on how we can save Mother Earth from the peril caused by pollution and environmental contamination.

            Earth. Home to almost 8 billion people <br />
            Earth. A mother to us that protects us from evil <br />
            But we are the ones putting Earth into misery <br />
            When will our Earth, our mother, finally be free? <br />
            But we don’t have to be so mean, we can stop <br />
            Take out trash, water a seed, pick up a mop! <br />
            Our mothers like to be sustainable and clean <br />
            Earth is covered in trash, when will it be seen? <br />
            It all begins with simple steps, very easy to do <br />
            To get you started, I’ll give you a small clue <br />
            A tray of food and wrappers, separate them as you go <br />
            Put them in the proper bins, which might be slow <br />
            We introduce you to the one and only machinery <br />
            Separate your trash and help Earth with ease <br />
            No need to stress about it, we got you covered <br />
            Try it out, it has now been discovered

  <center><h1>So, what's the problem?</h1>
    <p> Tons of trash, but nobody has the heart to help out. </p>
    <h1> How did we solve that? </h1>
    <p> We, GreenBot, have created an efficient machine that will allow users to learn the seperation of their trash successfully. </p>
    <h1>How long did it take?</h1>
    <p> It took at least 6 years to succesfully get up to this stage, but hey, we got it done! </p></center></center>
